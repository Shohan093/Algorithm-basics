# Algorithm

Written in C++. This repository contains some basic algorithms which can help with competitive programming and other things. Also contains some code snippets that can be used.

Note: Some of the algorithms are direct solutions to the problems of [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).
